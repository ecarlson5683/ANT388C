# Module 6:

> In the last module, we introduced the concept of version control and looked at tools for interfacing between between a repository maintained remotely on ***GitHub*** and a local repository, using the version control system, ***git***. Now, we are going to learn how we can use ***RStudio*** to manage the ***git/GitHub*** version control workflow. An additional objective of this module is to promote the ideas of reproducible research practice and literate programming by introducing you to **RMarkdown** and **Quarto**, which are both plain-text document formats that allow us to mix text and code in a flexible way and to generate a variety of nicely rendered outputs (e.g., websites, books, PDFs, presentations, and other media formats).

## Background

**Reproducible research** refers to the practice of conducting and disseminating scientific research in a way that makes data analysis (and scientific claims more generally) more transparent and repeatable. Academics already have means of sharing *methods* and *results* generally, through publications (although perhaps typically in less than complete detail), and we can share the data on which our analyses are based by depositing them in some form of online repository (e.g., via “supplementary information” that accompanies an article or by posting datasets to repositories like the [**Dryad Digital Repository**](http://datadryad.org/) or [**Figshare**](https://figshare.com/).

But how do we share the details of exactly how we did an analysis? And how can we ensure that it is possible for us to go back, ourselves, and replicate a particular analysis or data transformation? One solution is to integrate detailed text describing a workflow and analytical source code (such as ***R*** scripts) together in the same document.

This idea of tying together narrative, logic, specific code, and data (or references to them) in a single document stems from the principle of [**literate programming**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) developed by Donald Knuth. Applied to scientific practice, the concept of literate programming means documenting both the logic behind and analysis and the code used to implement that analysis using computer software. This documentation allows researchers to return to and re-examine their own thought processes at any later time, and also allows them to share their thought processes so that others can understand how an analysis was performed. The upshot is that our scholarship can be better understood, recreated, and independently verified.

This is the purpose of **RMarkdown** and **Quarto** documents.

[**Markdown**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is simply a formal way of styling a plain text document so that it can be easily rendered into HTML or PDF files for sharing or publishing. It is based on using some simple formatting and special characters to tag pieces of text such that a parser knows how to convert a plain text document into HTML or PDF. [**This link**](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) takes you to a classic description of **Markdown**, its syntax, and the philosophy behind it written by its creator, John Gruber. There are now several different “dialects” of **Markdown** that have been developed, derived from Gruber’s original suggestions, including a specific one used on ***GitHub*** called “GitHub Flavored Markdown”, or ***GFM***. A guide to this dialect is provided as a PDF [**here**](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) and is available online at [**this link**](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

**RMarkdown** and **Quarto** documents are very similar extensions of standard **Markdown** that allows you to embed chunks of ***R*** code (or code blocks of other programming languages, e.g., ***Python***, ***Latex***), along with additional parsing instructions and options for running code, in a plain text file. During the parsing and rendering (or “knitting”) stage, when the text file is being converted to HTML or PDF format, the output of running the embedded code can also be included.

A cheatsheet on **RMarkdown** syntax can be found [**here**](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf). **Quarto** documents use a separate piece of independent software, **quarto** (along with {knitr}, in some cases), to do the same thing. An overview and useful definitive guide to all you can do with Quarto can be found [**here**](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/).

> NOTE: See also Chapters 8 and 12 of the web book [**Happy Git and GitHub**](https://happygitwithr.com/) for the useR for more information on managing ***git*** and ***GitHub*** through ***RStudio***.

## Organizing work with ***R*** Projects
The easiest way to get ***RStudio*** to play nicely with ***git*** and ***GitHub*** for version control - and a recommended best practice - is to organize your work in ***RStudio*** using projects. You can think of an ***R*** project as a convenient workspace that is associated with its own working directory, data files, scripts, images, history log, etc. We might, for example, create a separate ***R*** project for each manuscript that we are working on.

creating an ***RStudio*** project means creating a special text file (“.Rproj”) that stores settings for particular ***RStudio*** setup and session. When we open an “.Rproj” file, the working directory is automatically set to the root directory for the project (i.e., the directory in which the actual “.Rproj” file is stored), which makes organizing and navigating around the computer’s filesystem, either from the command line or in ***R*** scripts within the project, much easier.

### Workflows for creating projects
For the sake of security, reproducibility, and collaboration, it makes a lot of sense for us to have all of our data science/data analysis projects both be under version control (e.g., using ***git***) and hosted remotely on a secure and reliable platform (e.g., ***GitHub***) that we and collaborators can access from different locations. There are multiple ways we can accomplish this.

For example, we could begin by setting up a new repository remotely, as we did in Module 05, and then “clone” it to our local computer and establish it as a version-controlled ***RStudio*** project. Alternatively, we could first create a new version-controlled ***RStudio*** project in a local directory and then push it up to ***GitHub*** or some other hosting site.

#### **Method 1**: Create a new ***RStudio*** project by cloning from a remote repository {.unnumbered}

The easiest way to get ***RStudio*** working nicely with ***git*** and ***GitHub*** is by creating a new repository on ***GitHub*** and then "cloning" this remote repository to a local computer and placing it under version control.

> **NOTE:** Before completing the following, you should make sure to **delete** any existing local version of the remote repository that you might have cloned previously, e.g., by moving it to the `Trash` on MacOS or the `Recycle Bin` on Windows. This is because if you try to clone a remote repository into an existing directory, you will get an error!

##### Step 1 {.unnumbered}

- First, as described in [**Module 05**](#module-05), go to your user profile in ***GitHub*** and create a new repository.

You will need to specify a repository name (with no spaces), whether it is a public or private repository, and whether to initialize the repository with one or more files already in it. I recommend initializing with both a "README" file and with a ".gitignore" file. You can also choose to use an ***R*** template to follow for the ".gitignore" file. The ".gitignore" file is simply a text document the provides ***git*** with a list of files that you ask it NOT to track changes to. These are typically either very large files (e.g., data files) or various hidden files that are either unnecessary or undesirable to track every single change to.

- Once your repository is created, go to the green "Code" popdown menu and click the clipboard icon to copy the repository's HTTPS URL. This is the same process we used in [**Module 05**](#module-05) for cloning a remote repository, and the URL is likely to be `https://github.com/` followed by `<your user name>/<your repository name>`).

##### Step 2 {.unnumbered}

- From the **File** menu in ***RStudio***, choose **New Project** and select to "Checkout a project from a version control repository"...

> **NOTE:** This step can also be done from the popdown menu located at the top right of the ***RStudio*** IDE.

- Choose the top item, "Clone a project from a Git repository"...

- In the subsequent dialog box, paste in the "Repository URL:" you copied in **Step 1**.

You can choose what parent folder to clone the repository into using the "Create project as a subdirectory of:" field (e.g., `~/Development/Repos`). In most cases, the "Project directory name:" field will be filled in automatically, as the name of the remote repository you are cloning.

Hitting the "Create Project" button will download the repository from ***GitHub*** into a new directory on your local computer. ***RStudio*** will close and reopen, after which the working directory will be set to the new local repository directory, which you can confirm by typing `getwd()` at the ***R*** console prompt. The local directory is now set up to be tracked by ***git*** on your local computer and should be connected to ***GitHub***.

Selecting the *Files* tab in ***RStudio*** will then show you all of the files in the newly created local repository, which should now contain a ".gitignore" file and an ".Rproj" file with the name of your project (e.g., "test-repo.Rproj"), in addition to the "README.md" file you created on ***GitHub***.

You should now also see a "Git" tab in the upper right pane of the ***RStudio*** IDE, and that tab should list the ".Rproj" file associated with the status `?`, indicating that it has not yet been added, committed, or synced with the remote repository. The other two files (".gitignore" and "README.md") are already in sync.

##### Other Notes {.unnumbered}

This process works identically if you want to clone a repo from ***GitHub*** that already has other files in it besides ".gitignore" and "README.md". In that case, ***RStudio*** will simply just create the ".Rproj" file and modify any existing ".gitignore" file to also include one or more other files that it recommends that ***git*** not track, e.g., ".Rproj.user". The new ".Rproj" file and modified ".gitignore" file, which were created locally, should appear under the "Git" tab with with the status `?` until you add, commit, and push them.

The process also works the same if you set up an empty repo on ***GitHub***, in which case you will have seen the window below immediately upon creating the repository:

Here, grabbing the URL from the "Quick setup" section and using that to set up a new project is ***RStudio*** is exactly the same process as we followed above.

> **NOTE:** You could also, in a terminal window, navigate to where you want the remote project to be cloned and follow either the "... or create" or "... or push" instructions listed. Doing so will link a local directory to the remote repo you created on ***GitHub*** BUT you will then not have created that as an ***RStudio*** project and would need to follow up with other instructions below about creating a new project from an existing local directory.

#### **Method 2**: Creating a new ***RStudio*** project under version control in a new directory {.unnumbered}

- In ***RStudio***, select **File \> New project** and click `New Directory`.

- Choose the project type as "New Project", then name the directory and choose where you would like it to be stored, checking the box marked `Create a git repository`, and pressing "Create Project".

- ***RStudio*** will create a new directory for you with an ".Rproj" file (with the name of your project) and a ".gitignore" file inside of it. This directory is now being tracked by ***git*** and ***RStudio***. You can now create and edit files in this new directory and stage and commit them locally directly from ***RStudio***. See the section below on ["Modifying Files Locally"](#modifying-local-files) in ***RStudio***.

> **NOTE:** It is important to remember that this project is still only under *local version control*... you will not yet be able to push changes up to ***GitHub***. To do that, see the section below on ["Connecting a Local Repo to ***GitHub***"](#connect-local-repo-to-github).

#### **Method 3**: Creating a new ***RStudio*** project in an existing directory {.unnumbered}

If you have an existing directory on your local computer that is already under ***git*** version control, then you can simply create a new ***RStudio*** project for that directory, and version control features will be automatically enabled. To do this:

- Execute the **New Project** command (from the **File** menu)
- Choose to create a new project from an `Existing Directory`

- Select the appropriate directory and then click **Create Project**

New ".Rproj" and ".gitignore" files will be created inside of that directory, and ***RStudio***'s version control features will then be available for that directory. Now, you can edit files currently in the directory or create new ones, as well as stage and commit them to the local repository directly from ***RStudio***. See the section below on ["Modifying Files Locally"](#modifying-local-files) in ***RStudio***.

If you create a new project for a directory that was *not* already under version control, you can enable version control within ***RStudio*** by choosing **Tools\>Project Options** to open the *Project Options* dialog box. Once there, go to the *Git/SVN* section and choose "Git" from the "Version control system" popdown menu, and then confirm that you want to set up version control for the project. You can also enable version control for a new project in a directory not formerly under version control by running the `use_git()` command from the {usethis} package. In either case, again, new ".Rproj" and ".gitignore" files will be created inside that directory, and ***RStudio***'s version control features will then be available.

> **NOTE:** Again, it is important to remember that local projects created via **Method 2** and **Method 3** are still only under *local version control*... you will not yet be able to push any additional files you add to the project directory or changes to local files up to ***GitHub***. To do that, see the section below on ["Connecting a Local Repo to ***GitHub***"](#connect-local-repo-to-github).

### Connecting a Local Repo to ***GitHub*** {#connect-local-repo-to-github .unnumbered}

To create a new remote repository on ***GitHub*** into which you can push the contents of an *existing* local repository, e.g., one created by **Method 2** or **Method 3** above, so that it is also backed-up off site and accessible to you or collaborators working at different locations, you have a couple of different options (see also Chapter 17 of the web book [*Happy Git and GitHub for the userR*](https://happygitwithr.com)).

#### **Option 1**: Use the {usethis} package to create a new remote repository on ***GitHub*** from within ***RStudio*** {.unnumbered}

##### Step 1 {.unnumbered}

- Configure a ***GitHub*** Personal Access Token (PAT):

  - Login to your ***GitHub*** account and go to the *Settings* tab. Then select `Developer Settings` and then `Personal Access Tokens`.
  - Select `Generate new token` and give it a nickname that reminds you of the intended purpose (e.g., "Access GitHub from RStudio").
  - Pick a *scope* that confers the privileges you need, e.g., `repo`, and then press the green "Generate Token" button.
  - The PAT will be displayed. It is a string of 40 random letters and digits. Copy this string to the clipboard.
  - Enter the PAT in your ".Renviron" file as a line that looks like this: `GITHUB_PAT=<your token>` (not in quotation marks).
  - The ".Renviron" file is a hidden file located in a user's home directory that can be used to set some default parameters for new ***R*** sessions. You can load and edit this with a function from the {usethis} package. At a console prompt, type `usethis::edit_r_environ()`. Your ".Renviron" file should open up in the ***RStudio*** editor. Add your the `GITHUB_PAT=<your token>` line as above, save and close the file. Be sure to put a line break at the end!
  - Restart R (**Session \> Restart R** in the ***RStudio*** menu bar), as environment variables are loaded from ".Renviron" only at the start of an ***R*** session. Check that the PAT is now available: `Sys.getenv("GITHUB_PAT")`. You should see your PAT print to screen.

##### Step 2 {.unnumbered}

- Create a remote repository on ***GitHub*** and push a local repository to it: 

  - Open the ***RStudio*** project that you want to create a remote repository for. This project needs to be under version control already and include at least one commit.
  - At the ***R*** console prompt within the project's working directory, type `usethis::use_github(protocol="https")`
  - Answer the question about whether the suggested name for the remote repository is adequate.
  - This should create a new repository on ***GitHub***, add it as a remote `origin/main`, set up a tracking branch, and open it in your browser.

From within ***RStudio***, you can now add or edit files to the project, locally commit any changes you make to those files, and push them up to ***GitHub*** as described above.

#### **Option 2**: Set up a dummy remote repository on ***GitHub*** and push to it from within ***RStudio*** {.unnumbered}

- Go to the ***GitHub*** website and create a new, empty repository. You can use the same name as that of the ***RStudio*** project you want to push up, or you can create a different one.

> **NOTE:** In setting up the repository on ***GitHub***, you should choose **not** to initialize the remote repository you are going to be pushing to with either a "README" or ".gitignore" file!

- From the *Git* tab in ***RStudio***, select the **New Branch** icon.

- Click "Add remote", paste in the URL for your dummy remote repository in the text field, and type in "origin" for the name of the remote branch.
- Click "Add". We should be back in the "New Branch" dialog box. Enter `main` as the branch name (to push from the local `main` branch to a remote `main`), and make sure "Sync branch with remote" button is checked.
- Click "Create" and in the next dialog box, choose "Overwrite". This should push your local repository `main` branch up to the remote `main` branch.

#### **Option 3**: Set up a dummy remote repository on ***GitHub*** and push to it from a terminal shell {.unnumbered}

- As in **Option 2**, go to the ***GitHub*** website and create a new, empty repository. You can use the same name as that of the ***RStudio*** project you want to push up, or you can create a different one.

> **NOTE:** Here, again, you should choose **not** to initialize the remote repository you are going to be pushing to with either a "README" or ".gitignore" file!

- From the next screen, select the desired transfer protocol you want to use under the `Quick setup...` option at the top (HTTPS or SSH). Then, scroll down to the option: `...or push an existing repository from the command line`.

- Copy the lines of code listed there and then return to ***RStudio***.
- In ***RStudio***, open the project that you want to push to ***GitHub*** and click **Tools \> Terminal \> New Terminal** or **Tools \> Shell...** to open a terminal window. Alternatively, open a separate terminal window and navigate to the root of the directory of the repository you wish to push.

> **NOTE:** It is important that you run these lines of code from within the directory that you wish to push to ***GitHub***. When you open a new terminal or shell from within ***RStudio***, you **should** be in the correct directory, as those processes open the shell in the current working directory. If not, though, use shell commands (i.e., `cd`) to navigate into the correct directory.

At the shell prompt, enter the lines of code you copied.

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your user name>/<your repository name>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

The first line tells ***git*** the remote URL that you are going to push to, the second makes sure you are on the `main` branch of the repository, and the third pushes your local repository `main` branch up to the remote `main` branch.

**Congratulations!** You have now pushed commits from a local repository to ***GitHub***, and you should be able to see those files in your remote ***GitHub*** repository online. The "Pull" (blue down arrow) and "Push" (green up arrow) buttons in ***RStudio*** should now also work.

> **IMPORTANT:** Remember, after each commit you do via ***RStudio*** (or via the command line), you will have to push to ***GitHub*** manually. This does not happen automatically!

> **NOTE:** Additional information on using projects in ***RStudio*** is available [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects).

### Troubleshooting {.unnumbered}

Most of the time, the installation and setup instructions provided in [**Module 05**](#module-05) and this module for getting ***git*** and ***RStudio*** to work together work just fine, but sometimes you may have issues. The most common problem I have seen is when ***RStudio*** is unable to find your proper ***git*** installation, either because the path to the correct ***git*** executable did not get written into your shell profile when you installed ***git*** or because the correct path to ***git*** has not be set properly in ***RStudio***.

Chapters 13 and 14 of the web book [*Happy Git and GitHub R*](https://happygitwithr.com) offer a number of suggestions for how to troubleshoot these problems, but some things to check are:

- Is ***git*** installed correctly? An easy way to test this is to enter `git` in a terminal shell. If you get a complaint about ***git*** not being found, it means either installation was unsuccessful or that the path to the ***git*** program is not on your `PATH` in your shell profile. Try reinstalling ***git*** and then either logging out of your computer and logging in again or restarting.
- Is the proper path to ***git*** set in ***RStudio***? In***RStudio***, go to **Tools\>Global Options** and select the "Git/SVN" tab and make sure that the box "Git executable" points to the executably file for your ***git*** installation. On macOS and Linux operating systems, the path usually is "/usr/bin/git" (on MacOS or Linux) and on Windows operating systems it is usually "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\git.exe". Sometimes, ***git*** will be installed in a slightly different place, most commonly (on MacOS) in "/usr/local/bin/git", in which case you will need to change the path in the dialog box. To find the correct path, type `which git` in a terminal shell and then enter that in the ""Git executable" box.

> **NOTE:** If you make any changes, e.g., if you reinstall ***git***, you will likely need to open a new shell window (so that your updated `PATH` gets read and your computer can find ***git***). You may also need to also either log out of your commputer and log in again or restart your computer. If you make changes in the ***RStudio*** IDE, e.g., if you change the path to your ***git*** executable via the **Tools\>Global Options\>Git/SVN** tab, you will need to completely **RESTART** ***RStudio***, and you may need to also log out and back in or restart your computer.

## Working with Projects in ***RStudio***

Once you have a project set up in ***RStudio*** and under version control, ***git*** will be watching your local project directory for any changes that you might make to what is contained in that directory or to the files therein. For example, if you add a file to the directory, it will show up in the *Files* tab, and if you delete a file, it will disappear from that list. Thus, you can drag and drop files and directories into and out of the project repo and ***git*** will keep track of them.

Now, you can edit existing files in the repository (e.g., the "README.md" file), create one or more new scripts (".R"), **RMarkdown** (".Rmd") files, or **Quarto** (".qmd") documents, add other files and folders (e.g., data files) to your repository and **git** will keept track of them.

### Modifying Files Locally {#modifying-local-files .unnumbered}

Within ***RStudio***, click on the "README.md" file to open it in the text editor panel of the IDE. Make some changes to this file (e.g., add the line, "And here is some new text I am adding in the RStudio IDE.") and then save your changes. When you do, the "README.md" file should show up in the *Git* tab with a blue "M" next to it, indicating that it has been "modified".

We can commit these changes to the local repository and push them up to ***GitHub*** as follows:

- Click the *Git* tab in upper right pane.
- Check the `Staged` box next to the "README.md" file, which will get the file ready to commit to your local repository. If you have not already done so, you should also stage the ".gitignore" and ".Rproj" files.

> **NOTE:** The ".gitignore" file that was created when you activated version control is basically a list of files that you want ***git*** to ignore and not worry about tracking changes to. By default, it includes the names of several files, e.g., ".Rhistory" and ".RData", which can be quite large and are not necessarily that important to track all changes to. You can also add to the ".gitignore" document the names of any other files in your working directory that you do not want ***git*** to track. These files can sit in your local working directory, unstaged and uncommitted, with no problems.

After being staged, the status of the files should turn to a green `A` (for "added").

- Click the "Commit" button. You will see a new, "Review Changes" window open up with the names of the files in your directory in the upper left pane. Selecting any of these will show you, in the lower pane, an overview of the differences between current version of the file and the version that was most recently previously committed.

- Enter an identifying "Commit message" in the box in the upper right pane, e.g., "First commit from RStudio" and then click "Commit".

A window will pop up confirming what you have just done, which you can then close.

If you now select the *History* tab in the "Review Changes" window, you can see the history of commits. Selecting any of the nodes in the commit history will show you (in the lower pane) the files involved in the commit and how the content of those files has changed since your last commit. For example, the node associated with your initial commit will show you the initial file contents, while subsequent nodes highlight where a new version differs from the previous one.

### Pushing Changes to a Remote Repo {.unnumbered}

- With your commits completed, the files disappear from the "Review Changes" window and from the *Git* tab in ***RStudio*** window (meaning they have all been committed locally). You should now be able to pass all of your local changes up to ***GitHub*** by clicking the green "Push" (up arrow) button. This updates the remote copy of your repository and makes it available to collaborators or to you, working on a different local computer.

You should see a dialog box indicating success

### Confirming Changes {.unnumbered}

Finally, you can confirm that the local changes were indeed sent up to the remote repository on ***GitHub*** by going back to the page for the repository in your web browser and hitting refresh... again, you should see that the "README.md" file has been updated with new text and, if you click on the "commits" tab, you should see one with the message "Commit from RStudio".

### CHALLENGE {.unnumbered}

Create and save a completely new text document in your current working directory/test repository - the content does not matter... be creative and try some markdown formatting! Save it as a file with the extension ".md" (for "markdown"), then commit that file to the local clone of your repository and push it from your local repository up to the `main` branch on ***GitHub***.

## Deleting Repositories

If you want to get rid of a local repository, you can simply send it to the `Trash` (on MacOS) or `Recycle Bin` (on Windows) and throw it away. It is just a regular, self-contained directory, and your local ***git*** executable will no longer track it.

If you want to get rid of a remote repository on ***GitHub***, navigate to the repository's web page in a browser, click on "Settings" tab, scroll down to bottom of the page in the "Danger Zone" section, and select the option "Delete this repository". You will be asked to type in the repository name to confirm that you want to delete it and will likely have to enter your ***GitHub*** password.

## Additional Resources

The web book [*Happy Git and GitHub for the useR*](https://happygitwithr.com) by Dr. Jenny Bryan (an important contributor to a number of key ***R*** packages) is an excellent source of information about how to set up and troubleshoot your ***RStudio/git/GitHub*** workflow... I encourage you to check it out!
